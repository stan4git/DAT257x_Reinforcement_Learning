    "This assignment features the Cartpole domain which tasks the agent with balancing a pole affixed to a movable cart. The agent employs two discrete actions which apply force to the cart. Episodes provide +1 reward for each step in which the pole has not fallen over, up to a maximum of 200 steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "* Implement a baselined version of REINFORCE\n",
    "* Define a Value function network $V_\\phi(s)$\n",
    "* Build the trainer and associated loss function\n",
    "* Train REINFORCE using baselined rewards  $\\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)=\\sum_{t=0}^T \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) (R - V_\\phi(s_t))$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criterion\n",
    "The main difference in a correct implementation of baselined REINFORCE will be a reduction in the variance. If correct, the baselined REINFORCE will achieve successful trials (of 200 steps) with a variance of less than 1000 on average, whereas the original REINFORCE was close to 2500.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baselined REINFORCE should still solve the Cartpole domain about as often as before, but now with a lower variance."
